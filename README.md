# vyn
This might be helpful for cpp users as this repository contains most of the commonly used functionalities in cpp as macros and functions, in a way to simplify the code on its usage. Hope this helps, Thanks!

The implementation of the vyn.cpp can be seen in vyn_implementation.cpp.

All of these programs must have vyn.cpp included as a header file to execute.

For ping checker, both check_ping.cpp and ping_checker.cpp are needed for execution along with vyn.cpp file.
